This file is simply meant to clear up the project details:

# main.ipynb

The final model from start to finish. It is also commmented with model choices.

# experiment_analysis.ipynb

This file is an all encompassing file showcasing my thought processes, specifically why choices were made. This includes hyperparameter tuning, model architecture, etc.

# generate_simulation.ipynb

This file creates the data by running hydrodynamics simulations.

# ml_functions.py

This file includes all the functions necessary for machine learning including loading and saving data, changing data structures appropriately, and forecasting using one step ahead.

# neural_network.py

Old file used for figuring out how to deal with all the simulation and model data.

# Note: Other files include data, predictions, model etrics, preliminary model tuning, and model.
