# Numerical Simulations of Multiscale Hydrodynamics for Strongly-Coupled Plasmas

In early 2021, I was quickly approaching the end of my bachelor's degree in mathematics. 
Going to school in the Silicon Valley, I had this nagging feeling that I was missing something in my education: programming. 
See I had spent my entire degree learning the theory behind linear algebra, analysis, and differential equations, and there was one thing that was made abundantly clear to me: real world problems do not have analytical solutions.
All of the ones that do had been solved by someone back in the 1700's.

So, I went to one of the applied mathematics professors in the department, Dr. Liam Stanton, and asked him for a project that could allow me to learn how to code.
His answer: computational fluid dynamics. This repository is the result.

My first goal was to simulate standard Euler hydrodynamics equations. (Note: Euler was a mathematician in the 1700's that developed these analytical equations to model fluid flow). 
Professor Stanton eventually became my master's thesis advisor, and the project slowly grew into what it is today: a multiscale hydrodynamics code invesitgating correlation models for excess (past mean field) correlations in strongly-coupled plasmas.
My master's degree coursework mainly focused on two areas: numerical methods for simulations, and statistics and data science.
These interests were reflected in the project as well.
I explore higher dimensional simulations as well as implement reduced order models, predictive machine learning models, and apply multiple types of spatio-temporal and spectral analysis.

After graduating with an MS in Applied Mathematics, my main intellectual focus shifted to other projects. However, this work is ongoing as I intend to publish these results.
